really unsure on the gamemodes (these are the closest I could get to survivor/creator/spectator/die forever/adventurer(person who moves and looks)
survival/creative/spectator/hardcore/adventure: jan li moli ala, jan li pali, jan li lukin, moli awen, jan li tawa li luken

also unsure on difficulties (did based on creatures)

chat visibility stuff (in particular translating command as "nimi lawa" "word of control")

jukebox: kalama lon poki (music in the box)
weather: kon (wind)
ambient/environment: ma (world)

stone types by colour
polished: sin (renew)

bedrock: kiwen li ken ala pakala (stone which cannot break)

unsure if to use extinct "leko" to mean block (really feel like I should generalise description of shapes beyond cubes)

translating chunks as "ma lili" (small worlds)

game menu: musi lipu
