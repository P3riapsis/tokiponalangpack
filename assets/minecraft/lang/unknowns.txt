really unsure on the gamemodes (these are the closest I could get to survivor/creator/spectator/die forever/adventurer(person who moves and looks)

also unsure on difficulties (did based on creatures)

chat visibility stuff (in particular translating command as "nasin nimi" "method word")

jukebox: kalama lon poki (music in the box)
weather: kon (wind)
ambient/environment: ma (world)

unsure if to use extinct "leko" to mean block (really feel like I should generalise description of shapes beyond cubes)
