really unsure on the gamemodes (these are the closest I could get to survive/create/spectate/die forever/hunt
survival/creative/spectator/hardcore/adventure: moli ala, pali, lukin, moli awen, alasa

also unsure on difficulties (did based on creatures)

chat visibility stuff (in particular translating command as "nimi lawa" "word of control")

jukebox: kalama lon poki (music in the box)
weather: kon (wind)
ambient/environment: ma (world)

stone types by colour
polished: sin (renew)

bedrock: kiwen li ken ala pakala (stone which cannot break)

unsure if to use extinct "leko" to mean block (really feel like I should generalise description of shapes beyond cubes)

translating chunks as "ma lili" (small worlds)

game menu: musi lipu
